# CodeAlpha_task3-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project demonstrates how to extract real-world data using web scraping techniques and then perform data visualization to uncover insights, patterns, and trends.
The workflow integrates web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization, showcasing how raw data from the web can be transformed into actionable information for analytics and decision-making.

⚙️ Key Steps

Web Scraping

Extracting structured/unstructured data from websites using tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium.

Handling pagination, dynamic content, and HTML parsing.

Saving scraped data in CSV/Excel/Database formats.

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removing duplicates and null values.

Converting data types for analysis.

Normalizing and formatting scraped data.

Data Visualization

Creating meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Charts and graphs include:

Line charts (trends over time)

Bar charts (comparisons)

Scatter plots (relationships)

Heatmaps (correlations)

Insights Generation

Identifying hidden patterns and anomalies.

Summarizing key findings through visual storytelling.
